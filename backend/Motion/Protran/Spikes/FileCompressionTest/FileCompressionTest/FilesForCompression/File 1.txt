2.3	Functionality 3: Integrated logging
•	Logging to console as well to file
•	Concept to avoid lost log entries
•	Compression of data
o	Only if also disrupted files can be restored as well
•	Flash lifetime is not taken into consideration during this test (we want to prove the performance)
•	Test log: Date and time stamp every 1 sec (low level), 1/10 sec (med level), 1/100 sec (high level) + ongoing counter since start + current CPU consumption of system
o	One log entry per line
•	Logging with three mentioned levels (to file AND console) should not cause any trouble for performance (video playback,2 tickers (see chapter 1.2, cycle1), IBIS reaction time)
•	Hardware: PM800
